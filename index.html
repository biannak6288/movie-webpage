        <p>[Virginia](VirginiaVenus.png)Virginia Venus is the second closest planet to Steven Sun, after Mercury, as well as the second smartest student of Solar High. She constantly receives an "A+" in school and due to her overly competent desires to succeed in her studies, she was
          never given a chance to love before. However, with the help of Evie Earth, she grows close with another student at Solar High. The connection between the two, despite their differences, cannot be broken! </p>

           Noah Neptune is the coolest planet in Solar High. All others bow down at his feet when they see him because he rules the school. Girl planets are always all over him, asking for his number and of course to take out.
          However, once he meets Virginia Venus, he believes that she is the girl of his dreams and therefore, changes his outlook on life. His new goal in school, is not to get as many girls as he can, but it is to improve his grades
          so that Virginia Venus would agree to go out with him! </p>

        <p>Steven Sun is the principal of Solar High. Little did we know, he is also the proud father of Virginia Venus. Crazy Right? Well, he knows that Noah Neptune isn't a good guy, but a player, therefore he forbids his daughter to date him. That remains
          his motto for much of the movie until Noah Neptune actual begins to change for the better. He turns into a respectful, mature, and intelligent young planet awaiting Steven Sun's approval to date Virginia. Steven Sun has
          his doubts, but agrees that Noah did change for the better, which means that he has to keep his promise.</p>
